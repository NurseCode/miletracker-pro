# MileTracker Pro

## Overview

MileTracker Pro is a client-side web application that simulates a mobile mileage tracking experience. The application allows users to track trips, categorize them for tax purposes, and generate reports. It uses browser-based storage (localStorage) to persist data and provides a mobile-first responsive design.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React (via CDN with Babel for JSX transformation)
- **UI Library**: Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- **Icon Library**: Font Awesome for icons
- **Charting**: Chart.js for reports and data visualization
- **Architecture Pattern**: Component-based Single Page Application (SPA)

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js serving static files
- **Purpose**: Simple static file server for development/demo purposes
- **Port**: 5000 (configurable via environment variable)
- **Hosting**: Configured for deployment on platforms like Replit

### Data Storage
- **Database**: localStorage (browser-based storage)
- **Data Structure**: JSON objects stored as strings
- **Tables/Collections**: 
  - `miletracker_trips` - Trip records
  - `miletracker_active_trip` - Currently active trip
  - `miletracker_settings` - User preferences
  - `miletracker_rates` - Custom mileage rates

## Key Components

### Core Services
1. **DatabaseService**: Manages localStorage operations for trips and settings
2. **LocationService**: Handles geolocation APIs and location tracking
3. **TripService**: Manages trip lifecycle (start, stop, tracking)

### UI Components
1. **Dashboard**: Main overview with statistics and trip tracking controls
2. **TripList**: Display and manage existing trips with filtering/sorting
3. **TripDetails**: View and edit individual trip information
4. **AddTrip**: Manual trip entry form
5. **Reports**: Generate charts and export trip data
6. **Settings**: Configure app preferences and mileage rates

### Utility Modules
1. **Constants**: IRS mileage rates, categories, and configuration
2. **Calculations**: Distance calculations using Haversine formula

## Data Flow

1. **Trip Tracking**: User starts trip â†’ Location tracking begins â†’ GPS coordinates collected â†’ Trip automatically stopped when stationary
2. **Manual Entry**: User fills form â†’ Data validated â†’ Trip saved to localStorage
3. **Data Persistence**: All data stored in browser's localStorage as JSON
4. **Reports**: Data retrieved from localStorage â†’ Processed for charts â†’ Displayed using Chart.js
